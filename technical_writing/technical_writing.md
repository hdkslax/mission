### How to write good?

1. Avoid Alliteration (典故). Always.
2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
3. Avoid clichés like the the plague. They're old hat.
4. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
5. Be more or less specific.
6. Writers should never generalize.
7. Seven: Be consistent!
8. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.

### Poor writing

- may be ambiguous - results in misunderstanding by readers.
- may contain omissions (遗漏) - frustration (挫折) by readers.
- may be obscure (晦涩的) - readers struggle to understand the text.
- Poorly presented material carries a subconscious (潜意识的) message.
- Numerous spelling errors → readers are inclined not to believe the writer.
- Sloppy presentation (草率的演讲) → little care taken by writer.

If the ideas are clearly expressed & well organized, then the document should be easy to read.

### Why would someone write something that is unclear?

- Afraid of making mistakes, so every word and phrase are labored over (费尽心思).
- Wishes to impress audience with big words and complicated sentence structures.

# 3 - Rubrics 评估准则

> If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads.   — Anatole France

### Content outside the scope of the course

- Legal writing
- Medical writing

### No Rubrics provided in advance

mistakes == learning

You are encouraged to appeal anything and everything in the course!

### Experiential Learning

People learn better by participating and actively doing than passively observing others do things.

(We are given problems and assignments before the topics are discussed.)

You should be doing things **important to you!**

- more meaningful!
- more effort and care
- better retention (less reliance on memorization) 减少对记忆的依赖
- fewer "why are we doing this?" questions

(Ask questions if an assignment, journal, or anything else in the course is unclear.)

### Writing Stages

- Brainstorm
- organize
- rough draft
- edit & revise
- 2nd Draft
- edit & revise
- "final" draft

### Brainstorming

"Whenever we reflect on what we write as we write it, we become self-conscious and lose the flow of that writing, sometimes to the point of near-paralysis. It passes."

DO NOT:

- edit
- stop
- revise
- contemplate (沉思)
- reflect
- slow down
- be concerned with writing something "dumb"

DO:

- keep momentum (保持势头)
- attain flow
- write EVERYTHING **down**

# 4 - Spectrum 光谱

> Put down everything that comes into your head and then you're a writer. But an author is one who can judge his own stuff's worth, without pity, and destroy most of it.   — Collette

### Example sentence to rewrite

```
From my research, we can purchase this software for the company and allow us to save a significant amount of money.
```

**Revised:**

```
Software X will save us $10,000 per year.
```

**Alternative Revised Version:**

```
Software X will save the company $10,000 per year.
```



An **important skill** to develop in this course: quickly explaining differences between the sentence variants.



### Spectrum of Word Edit Types

- redundancy
- concision 简洁
- empty / filler words (adding zero) 填充词
- avoid pronouns 避免代词
- metadiscourse 元话语
  - the writer's thinking and writing: we will explain, show, argue, claim, deny, suggest, contrast, summarize ...
  - the writer's degree of certainty: it seems, perhaps, undoubtedly, I think... ( we call these hedges and intensifiers)
  - the readers' action: consider now, as you might recall, look at the next example...
  - the writing itself and logical connections among its parts: first, second, third,; to begin, finally, therefore, however, consequently..."
- avoid discourse markers 避免话语标记
  - 在语言学中，话语标记是指在句法上独立的一个单词或一个短语，它一般在句中起提示、停顿或过度的作用，大多数时候没有实际意义，如果去掉也不会影响句子的意思。
  - 英语中典型的例子有:
    - oh, well, now, then, you know, I mean
    - the connectives: so, because, and, but, or 等等
- weasel words / hedging 模糊词

### Removing words (most significant type of edit)

- redundancy
- concision 简洁
- empty / filler words (adding zero)
- avoid pronouns
- metadiscourse
- avoid discourse markers

### Replacing words 

- empty / filler words (adding zero)
- avoid discourse markers
- weasel words / hedging 模糊词/模糊陈述



# 5 - Word Choice

> Education… has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distiguish what is worth reading. 

### Word Choice (def)

Finding the words that best reflect and say what you want to say while avoiding to confuse the reader. 

For example: One could refer to “data structure” in any of the following ways:

``` 
Data structure in algorithms.
Data structure
DS
Information Storage Representation. (信息存储表示)
(uncommon, idiosyncratic usage 特殊的用途)
```



### Words: What is wrong with These?

<font color=red>Finding</font> the <font color=red>words</font> that best <font color=red>reflect</font> and <font color=red>say what you want to say </font>while <font color=red>avoiding to confuse</font> the reader. 

- **Finding** - implies *discovery*, *serendipity*(意外发现珍奇事务的本领), *change*…
- **words** - are we defining “*word choice*” or “*words choice*”? It’s “*word choice*”.
- **reflect** - “reflect” is like a mirror, replace it with word “mirror” in the sentence is improper. metaphorical, non-literal
- **say** - words do not speak
- **say what you want to say** - convoluted 费解的
- **you** - avoid (unnecessary) pronouns
- **avoid to confuse** - confusing

Summary: Poor word choice in the definition of “*word choice*”.

**Revision 1**

<font color="red">Selecting</font> the word that <font color="red">most accurately</font> represents what you are <font color="red">trying to say</font> while minimizing ambiguity. 

**Revision 2**

Writing with words that best communicates the writer’s intent while minimizing ambiguity. 

**Revision 3**

Writing with unambiguous words optimizes clarity.



The explicit goal is concision = short sentence + more direct + removing everything unnecessary, confusion, redundant. 



### GPU (example)

Think: 

- Does everyone know what a GPU is?

##### Identify words & phrases to revise

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. 

Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. 

Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. 

In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. 

In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.

### Parts of a Proposal

All proposals have an “**Introduction**” section that introduces *the context of the problem* (rarely sometimes called “*Background*” or “*Context*”).

A proposal that employs **visual cues** (e.g., titles & headings) is more likely to be approved at the first stage compared to a proposal that is **difficult to visually navigate**.  

**Headings** and **sub-headings** helps readers follow the logic and overall structure of the proposal.
